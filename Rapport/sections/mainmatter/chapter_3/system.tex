In this chapter a model of and requirements to the system addressed in the problem statement is specified. This specification remains on a superficial level as a foundation to the system design in chapter \ref{ch7}. Furthermore test specifications of the system are made, by means of the used development model called the V-model. By this a delimitation of the project will be established. \\   
\\
Due to the presented problem statement the purpose of the application is basically to transform some music into a note sheet due to the sound. This is illustrated by figure \ref{fig:model1}.

\end{tikzpicture}

\label{fig:model1}
\end{figure}
In order for an application to perform this transformation an analogue sound has to be converted into a discrete time signal, in order for a computer to process the signal into the wanted outcome. \\
By this the system is fundamentally based upon theory about discrete time systems, including analysis and processing of such systems and the disposal data.

\section{Synthesizing}
To develop/design the system a synthesis approach is used to expand the basic concept of the system in order to define the purpose and thereby requirements to each part of the system.
Figure \ref{fig:synth} illustrates the synthesizing of the system down to a level showing the essential parts of the system on behave of the final purpose. The further synthesizing of the system are left for chapter \ref{ch7}\trine{will it be synthesizing i chaper 7?}. The next section define the requirements for each part of the system.

\subsection{Requirements}
\subsubsection{Input}
To be able to process an analogue sound in a computer the sound has to be digitalized. This is done by an analogue to digital converter(ADC) which transform an audio signal\trine{audio signal: elektrisk signal hvis spænding samples} from a microphone into bits. Further these bits has to be stored as a datafile suited to the further algorithm. \\
This process are to be done by the audio card in the  computer and some storage software. The software needs to provide a sampling frequency at 44,1 kHz and a bit resolution of 16 bits.\cite{Mic} \\      
The produced audio file will provide as the input for the algorithm that process the sound. 
The audio files for this are limited to consist of single tones, meaning no cords, and will be recorded in
