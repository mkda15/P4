\chapter{Discrete-time systems}\label{discrete_time_systems}
This chapter is inspired by \cite{FSP}.\\\\
This chapter will establish the theory of discrete-time systems needed for the further discussion of sampling theory, the discrete Fourier transform and filtering. Firstly, discrete-time systems are defined in definition \ref{def:discrete_time_system}.
