\section{Signal-to-noise ratio}
Signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) is a measure of the amount of noise in a signal. The SNR is defined as
\begin{equation}\label{eq:SNR}
SNR=\frac{\sigma_{signal}^2}{\sigma_{noise}^2}
\end{equation}
where $\sigma_{signal}^2$ is the variance of the wanted signal and $\sigma_{noise}^2$ is the variance of the noise. In this section the recorded music will be added noise in various level such that the SNR is changed. The peak detection algorithm is then used to find peaks, and it is observed when it does not manage to find the right peak as a consequence of the excessive noise in the signal.
