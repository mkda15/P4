\chapter{Conclusion}
Through this report is it documented how an application for generating a spectrogram on behalf of an audio file can be carried out.\\
The system takes an recorded input signal, the signal is filtered to reduce noise, next the signal is transformed to the frequency domain to be represented by a spectrogram, from which the significant frequencies to a given time is identified and presented by a plot. (The intention of this output is the possibility to recognize the tones played in order to compute a corresponding note sheet.)\\
To reduce additive noise from the signal a  filter was designed as a bandpass type 1 FIR filter with use of a kaiser window which provides a window length of 2766 on behalf of given specification. It is shown that the filter succeeds in removing all frequencies outside the passband as intended.\\

The discrete Fourier transform is used as a mathematical tool present the frequency spectrum of the signal. In particular the short-time-fourier transform was used to compute a spectrogram. From experimental test it was
