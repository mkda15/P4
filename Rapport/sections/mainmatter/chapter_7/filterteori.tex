\section{Basic principals}
When a discrete signal $x[n]$ are sent into a system that gives the output $y[n]$ it is the impulse response of the system $h[n]$ that determined how the input signal are affected. The output are determined by the convolution of input signal and impulse response of the system. Such systems are refereed to as a digital filter with impuls response $h[n]$. 
\begin{align}
x[n]*h[n]=y[n]
\end{align}
