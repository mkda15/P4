\section{Filter design}
In this section the process of designing digital filter are described. There will be a distinguished between techniques for IIR and FIR filters..\\
As described ideal filters are not computable hence the process of designing a filter is based on approximation of the frequency response made by computable polynomials.  


\subsection{IIR filter}
One common way of designing an IIR-filter is to design the discrete-time filter from a corresponding continuous-time system. The idea follows three main steps. 
\begin{itemize}
\item[1.] Specify the properties desired for the filter.
\item[2.] Hereby compute a "prototype" by a continuous-time system $H_c(j\Omega)$ that approximates the given properties.
\item[3.] Transform the "prototype" into the discrete-time filter $H(e^{j\omega})$ by... 
\end{itemize}
The properties of a system are specified on behave of the desired application, considering what frequencies are to pass the filter ideally. Further it is important to specify how much the filter are allowed to vary from the ideal properties, from which it will vary. \\
Properties for an approximation to a lowpass filter could be defined by bounding the magnitude within $\pm \ \delta_1$ of unity in a limited frequency band $0 \leq \Omega \leq \Omega_p $ and less than $\delta_2$ in the frequency band $\Omega_s \leq \Omega$\trine{beskrivelse af convertering af spec. er udkommenteret}. 
The tolerance scheme pleasing the continuous-time filter is illustrated on figure \ref{fig:scheme}\\ 
The transition off nonzero width between the cutoff frequency of passband and stopband is necessary in order for the system to be realizable.

\end{figure}

Methods for defining a continuous-time system that fits the specification are establish as known continuous-time filter designs. The \textit{Butterworth filter} which is a lowpass filter approximation will now be described along with the Bbiliniare transformation.\\
For a Butterworth filter the squared magnitude are defined as follows.
\begin{align}\label{eq:butter}
|H_c(j\Omega)|^2=\frac{1}{1+\left( \frac{j\Omega}{j\Omega_c}\right)^{2N}}
\end{align} 
Further the filter is characterised by the following three properties.
\begin{align}
1.& \ \ \ |H_c(j\Omega)|^2 = 1 \  \ \left|\begin{matrix}
\\ 
\Omega=0
\end{matrix}\right. , \textit{ for all }N. \\
2.& \ \ \ |H_c(j\Omega)|^2 = \frac{1}{2} \  \ \left|\begin{matrix}
\\ 
\Omega=\Omega_c
\end{matrix}\right. , \textit{ for all }N. \\
3.& \ \ \ \textit{Magnitude response is monotonic in pass- and stopband.}
\end{align}
As the order $N$ of the filter increases the characteristics become sharper and the filter approximates the ideal lowpass filter. This is illustrated on figure \ref{fig:butter}. By\eqref{eq:butter} it is possible to compute the order necessary for the system to fulfil the specifications.            
\begin{figure}[H]
    \centering
    \includegraphics[width = 0.6\textwidth]{figures/butterworth.png}
    \caption{Magnitude of Butterworth filter depending on order $N$ }
    \label{fig:butter}
\end{figure} 
In order to obtain causality and stability in the system representation in the $s$-domain is wanted. By substituting $s=j\Omega$ the following relation is true.
\begin{align}
|H_c(j\Omega)|^2 = H_c(s)H_c(-s)= \frac{1}{1+\left( \frac{s}{j\Omega_c}\right)^{2N}}
\end{align} 
By letting the denominator in \eqref{eq:butter} equal to zero it is possible to determine the poles $s_k$ of the system as 
\begin{align}
s_k = (-1)^{\frac{1}{2N}}\left(j\Omega_c\right)=\Omega_c\text{e}^{\left(\frac{j\pi}{2N}\right)\left(2k+N-1\right)}, \ \ k=0,1,\ ... \ , 2N-1 
\end{align}   
The poles will placed equally along the circle of radius $\Omega_c$ as illustrated on figure \ref{??}. By only considering the poles in the left half plane $H_c(s)$ can be construed as a stable system. 
\begin{align}
H_c(s)=\frac{1}{\prod_{k=1}^{N}(s-s_k)}
\end{align}    
When the continuous-time filter $H_c(s)$ is defined the next step is the transformation from continuous-time to discrete-time. The bilinear transformation is a method that allows a direct transformation between the s- and z-domain. The principal of the transformation is that the imaginary axis $j\Omega$ of the s-plane is mapped onto the z-plane as the unitcircle. The bilinear transformation is defined by 
\begin{align}
s=\frac{2}{T_d}\left(\frac{1-z^{-1}}{1+z^{-1}}\right) 
\end{align}
such that 
\begin{align}
H_c\left[\frac{2}{T_d}\left(\frac{1-z^{-1}}{1+z^{-1}}\right)\right]=H_c(z), 
\end{align}  
Because $-\infty \leq \Omega \leq \infty $ is mapped to $-\pi \leq \omega \leq \pi$ the transformation most be non linear which involves some frequency distortion. By this the method is restricted to situations where this is acceptable or can be compensated. Compensation can be done by the concept of pre wrapping, that consider the relation 
\begin{align}
\Omega_{c_{new}}=\frac{2}{T_d}\tan\frac{\omega_c}{2}
\end{align}
hereby it is possible to determine a new $\Omega_c$ to the continuous-time filter, in order to ensure the discrete $\omega_c$ to fit the specification.\\
An important property of the bilinear transformation is that stability is preserved if the continuous-time filter i stable. \\


%
%These properties are to be converted into specifications of the discrete-time filter by expressing the frequency in normalised radian frequency by the relation $\omega=\Omega T_d$ where $T_d$ is the sampling rate. Thus the impulse response is specified over one period as 
%\begin{align}
%H_c(j\Omega)=H(e^{j\omega}), \ \ |\omega|<\pi
%\end{align}    
%
%The desired gain of the magnitude is often expressed in dB, where $20\log(1)=0[\text{dB}]$ \trine{is gain of magnitude a thing?} \\
 

\subsection{FIR filter}
Design of FIR filters are in contrast to IIR filters based on approximating the desired discrete-time frequency response directly. By this method it is possible to guarantee a general linear phase of the system. The window method..   

\subsubsection{The Window method}
The window method is considered a simple method for designing FIR filters. The method takes off from the desired frequency response $H_d$ whereby the desired impulse response is obtained by the inverse Fourier transformation of frequency response
\begin{align}
h_d[n]=\frac{1}{2\pi}\int_{-\pi}^{\pi} H_d(\text{e}^{j\omega})\text{e}^{j\omega} d\omega
\end{align}
The idealized frequency response usually results in impulse responses of infinite length and discontinuities at the boundaries between pass- and stopband. To compute a finite casual system as a FIR filter on behave of the desired impulse response the realisable impulse response of the FIR filter is determined as a product of the idealised impulse response $h_d[n]$ and a finite duration \textit{window} $w[n]$ 
\begin{align}
h[n]=h_d[n]w[n], \ \ w[n] =
\left\{ \begin{matrix}
f[n], &\ 0 \leq n \leq M \\
0, &\ Otherwise
\end{matrix}\right.
\end{align}       
By this truncation the impulse response of a finite filter of order $M$ is determined such that
\begin{align}
h[n]= 
\left\{ \begin{matrix}
h_d[n], &\ 0 \leq n \leq M \\
0, &\ Otherwise
\end{matrix}\right.
\end{align}
By Fourier transformation the frequency response of the filter becomes the periodic convolution 
\begin{align}
H(e^{j\omega})=\frac{1}{2\pi}\int_{-\pi}^{\pi} X(e^{j\theta})W(e^{j(\omega-\theta})d\theta
\end{align} 
This is illustrated by an example of the simple \textit{rectangular window} defined as 
\begin{align}
w[n] =
\left\{ \begin{matrix}
1, &\ 0 \leq n \leq M \\
0, &\ Otherwise
\end{matrix}\right.
\end{align}
which by Fourier transformation gives 
\begin{align}
W \left(\text{e}^{j\omega}\right)=\sum_{n=0}^{M} \text{e}^{j\omega n} = \frac{1- \text{e}^{-j\omega(M+1)}}{1- \text{e}^{-j\omega}} = \text{e}^{-j\omega \frac{M}{2}} \frac{ \sin \left( \frac{\omega \left( M+1 \right)}{2} \right)}{\sin \left( \frac{\omega}{2} \right)} 
\end{align}

Figure \ref{fig:FIR1} illustrates the convolution process referred to as windowing\trine{lav selv prÃ¦cis figur}. note that ripples appear in both pass and stopband. 
\begin{figure}[H]
    \centering
    \includegraphics[scale=0.4]{figures/FIR1.png}
    \caption{a) Frequency response $H(e^{j\omega})$ and Fourier transformation of window $W(e^{j\omega})$ b) Approximation of $H(e^{j\omega})$ resulting from windowing the desired impulse response.}
    \label{fig:FIR1}
\end{figure}  
The aim is to approximate the desired frequency response as good as possible. For $w[n]=1 \ \forall \ n$, $W(e^{j\omega})$ becomes a periodic impulse which implies $H(e^{j\omega})=H_d(e^{j\omega})$ though the needed truncations is not performed. The impulse train is best approximated by letting the main lobe of $W(\text{e}^{j\omega})$ be as narrow as possible and the side lobes as small as possible. This corresponds respectively to minimizing the width of the transitband and the ripples in pass and stop band, though it is not possible to achive both at ones.\\
By increasing M the with of the main-lope is decreased, but the peak amplitude of the side-lopes also increases which results in ripples. this indicates a trade-off between main width of main-lope and amplitude of side-lopes. \\
Figure \ref{?} illustrates main and side lope by a plot of the magnitude response corresponding to the rectangular window\trine{indsÃ¦t figur}.

\subsubsection{Different types of windows}
The rectangular window is one out of many windows, that have different properties. The oscillations in the frequency response is a result of Gibbs phenomenon. According to converges of Fourier series\trine{uddybes her?} this can be improved by convolving the desired frequency response with a less abrupt window. So by narrowing each end of the rectangle smoothly towards zero, the amplitude peak of the side-lopes are remarkable decreased. Though this will still result in a wider main-lope. \\
In table \ref{tab:window} some commonly used windows are defined, further the windows and the corresponding Fourier transformation are illustrated on figure \ref{fig:window_types} and \ref{?}

\begin{table}[H]

\caption{Definition of different types of windows}
\label{tab:window}
\begin{tabular}{l|l} \hline

\left\{ \begin{matrix}

0, &\ Otherwise
\end{matrix}\right. $ \\ \hline
Bartlett    & $w[n] =
\left\{ \begin{matrix}
\frac{2n}{M}, &\ 0 \leq n \leq \frac{M}{2} \\
\frac{2-2n}{M}, &\ \frac{M}{2} \leq n \leq M \\
0, &\ Otherwise
\end{matrix}\right.$ \\ \hline
Hanning     & $w[n] =
\left\{ \begin{matrix}
0.5-0.5 \cos(\frac{2\pi n}{M}), &\ 0 \leq n \leq M \\
0, &\ Otherwise
\end{matrix}\right. $ \\ \hline
Hamming     & $w[n] =
\left\{ \begin{matrix}
0.54-0.46 \cos(\frac{2\pi n}{M}), &\ 0 \leq n \leq M \\
0, &\ Otherwise
\end{matrix}\right. $ \\ \hline
Balckman    &  $w[n] =
\left\{ \begin{matrix}
0.42-0.5 \cos(\frac{2\pi n}{M}) + 0.08 \cos(\frac{4\pi n}{M}), &\ 0 \leq n \leq M \\
0, &\ Otherwise
\end{matrix}\right.$  \\ \hline
\end{tabular}
\end{table}   

\begin{figure}[H]
    \centering
    \includegraphics[scale=0.8]{figures/filter_teori/window_types.pdf}
    \caption{w[n] of respective windows of order $M = 8$}
    \label{fig:window_types}
\end{figure}  

The defined windows all has the property of being symmetric around the point $\frac{M}{2}$, hence if the desired impulse response is also symmetric the windowed impulse will be symmetric which results in a frequency response with generalized linear phase. \\
To conclude this section it is seen that in order to design a FIR filter by the window method one can vary the chosen window and the order of the system, until the desired specification are archived. 
\subsubsection{The Kaiser window method}
The Kaiser window design method consider the Kaiser window as the near-optimal window which -  compared to the other windows - has two parameters; the lenght $M+1$ and a shape parameter $\beta$. This results in \textit{one} window where changing the parameters adjusts shape and length of the window in order to achieve the optimal trade off between amplitude of side lopes and width of main lope. The Kaiser window is defined as 
\begin{align}
w[n]=\left\{\begin{matrix}
 \frac{I_0[\beta (1-[\frac{n-\alpha}{\alpha}]^2)^{\frac{1}{2}}]}{I_0(\beta)} , &\ 0 \leq n \leq M  \\ 
0, &\ Otherwise
\end{matrix}\right.
\end{align}        
where $\alpha=\frac{M}{2}$ and $I_0(\cdot)$ the zero'th order modified Bessel function of the first kind.\cite{DTSP, p.474-476} Increasing $\beta$ tapers the window in the time domain, which results in smaller side lopes of the Fourier transform. Increasing $M$ causes the width of the main lope to increase though without changing the peak amplitude of the side lopes. This i illustrated on figure \ref{?} and \ref{?} respectively.\\
In order to determine values for $\beta$ and $M$ according to the satisfy the desired specifications the following formulas are defined. First note that the peak approximation error $\delta$ - by the method of Kaiser - is determined on behave of $\beta$. Considering a lowpass filter, with a fixed $\delta$ this gives a cut off frequency of the passband $\omega_p$ defined by $|H(\text{e}^{j\omega})| \geq 1-\delta$ and cut off stopband frequency $\omega_s$ defined by $|H(\text{e}^{j\omega})| \leq \delta$. This gives a transitionband of width $\delta \omega = \omega_s - \omega_p$. Defining $\delta$ in $[dB]$ by $A=-20\log_{10} \delta$ is it possible to determine the value of $\beta$ on behave of a specific value of $A$ as 
\begin{align}
\beta =
\left\{ \begin{matrix}
0.1102\left( A-8.7 \right), &\ A \geq 50 \\
0.5843\left(A-21\right)^{0.4}, &\ 21 \leq A \leq 50 \\
0.0, &\  A \leq 21 
\end{matrix}\right.
\end{align}               
Furthermore $M$ must satisfy the following relation. 
\begin{align}
M=\frac{A-8}{2.285\Delta \omega} 
\end{align}	
By this establishment of the Kaiser window method it is possible to design a FIR filter within desired specifications with almost no iterations or trial and error. By adjusting the shape parameter $\beta$ it is possible to obtain a window equivalent to each of the windows defined in table \ref{tab:window} with a more narrow transition width, which could make the Kaiser window preferable.       
\subsection{Comparison of IIR and FIR filters}
... \\
Advantages of IIR filter:
The process of designing a IIR filter is rather simple when the desired properties fits an establish design method such as a Butterworth filter. The required order of the filter is computable and the transformation to the discrete-time domain is to be done straight forward. Further, considering the implementation, this leads to non iterative algorithms. \\
Though by this method the magnitude response is the only parameter to be specified. Meaning that specific requirements for e.g. phase response or group delay are not quarantined to be fulfilled by this kind of IIR filter.

\subsection{Anti aliasing filter}
As mentioned in section \ref{ADC} an anti aliasing filter is required in the ADC process. The purpose of filter is to avoid the aliasing phenomenon which occurs when the samplings theorem \ref{sampling_theorem} is not fulfilled. As stated a signal has to be band limited by the Nyquist frequency $\omega_N$ and since a continuous-time signal such as a sound is not guaranteed to have a bandlimited frequency the anti aliasing filter is design to remove the frequencies that are above the Nyquist frequency. \\
An anti aliasing filter typically form an analogue low pass filter, with the Nyquist frequency as the ideal cut off frequency. Though as seen a transition band is necessary - when designing a practical filter - in which the frequencies can cause aliasing. This causes the passband cut of frequency to be larger than the Nyquist frequency.\trine{how larger}
