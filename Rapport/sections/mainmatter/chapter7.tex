\chapter{Filtering} \label{ch7}
It is wanted to reduces noise on the music signal that is to be processed by the application hence this chapter introduces the basic filter theory necessary for the system. Mathematical ideal filters are described and related to relevant acoustic signals and the noise that is expected on such acoustic signals. Further techniques for design of practical non ideal filters are described including ... This chapter is inspired by \cite{DTSP, ch. 5,7} and \cite{FSP, sec. 3.4.4}\\
Note that filters concerned in the project are only digital filters, meaning the filter is a algorithm to be executed on the computer. An analogue filter are instead constructed by physical component. Both types relay on the I/O-relation that are to be mathematical represented.
