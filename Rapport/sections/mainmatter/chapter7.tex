\chapter{Filtering} \label{ch7}
It is wanted to reduces noise on the music signal that is to be processed by the application hence this chapter introduces the basic filter theory necessary for the system. Basic theory concerning mathematically ideal filters is described, followed by techniques for design of practical non ideal filters. This chapter is inspired by \cite{DTSP, ch. 5,7} and \cite{FSP, sec. 3.4.4}\\
Note that filters concerned in the project are only digital filters, meaning the filter is a algorithm to be executed on a computer. An analog filter is in contrast constructed by physical component. Both types relay on the input/output relation that are to be mathematical represented.
