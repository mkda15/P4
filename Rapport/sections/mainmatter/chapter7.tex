\chapter{Filtering} \label{ch7}
It is wanted to reduces noise on the music signal that is to be processed by the application hence this chapter introduces the basic filter theory necessary for the system. Mathematical ideal filter are described and related to relevant acoustic signals and what noise that is expected on such acoustic signals. Further techniques for design of non ideal filters are described. This chapter is inspired by \cite{DTSP}
