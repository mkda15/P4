\chapter{Peak detection with varying noise levels} \label{ch11}
In this chapter the peak detection algorithm is tested under varying signal-to-noise ratios. The goal is to investigate the usefulness of the implemented algorithm when the recorded music includes varying levels of noise.\\\\
The Python-scripts used to create the figures in this chapter are found in appendix \ref{app:sup}.
