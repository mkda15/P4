\chapter{Wavelet Analysis}
The purpose of this chapter is merely to introduce the concept of wavelet analysis in order to apply it as an alternative to the Fourier transform described and applied in the former chapters. The chapter is inspired by \cite{page 159-?, FSE2010} \martin{Overvej dette. \textregistered}.
