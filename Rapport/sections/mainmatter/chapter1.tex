\chapter{Overskrift} \label{ch1}
In this chapter an introduction will lead to a discussion of problems encountered in the musical world when music is to be transcribed. The importance of these problems is analysed and the need for a solution assessed whereafter existing and possible solutions with roots in mathematics will be presented. The chapter will conclude with a \textit{problem statement} which will form the basis for the rest of the project.
\section{Introduction}
Some musicians are capable of playing without reading music written on a sheet of music, and they invent new music through a creative process without themselves writing sheets of music but by ear. Creative thinking is however interuptable and this can be problematic when the need for transcribing a composition to a note sheet arises so as to remember or convey it to others - this may ruin the creative proces by exactly interrupting it because one needs to concentrate on the writing.\\\\
To ease the creative process of a musician it is imaginable that some kind of automatic real time transcription of musical compositions can be developed which will eliminate the problem of having to interrupt the aforementioned process.\\\\
\section{Problem analysis}
Aforementioned problem is not the only problem to be considered, when the need for transcribing music arises. Reading sheet
