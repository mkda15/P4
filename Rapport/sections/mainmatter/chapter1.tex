\chapter{Overskrift} \label{ch1}
In this chapter an introduction will lead to a discussion of problems encountered in the musical world when music is to be transcribed. The importance of these problems is analysed and the need for a solution assessed whereafter existing and possible solutions with roots in mathematics will be presented. The chapter will conclude with a \textit{problem statement} which will form the basis for the rest of the project.
\section{Introduction}
Some musicians are capable of playing without reading music written on a sheet of music, and they invent new music through a creative process where they play by ear and do not have the need to write down their compositions. Creative thinking is however interruptable and this can be problematic when the need for transcribing a composition to a sheet of music arises so as to remember or convey it to others - this may ruin the creative proces by exactly interrupting it because one needs to concentrate on the writing.\\\\
To ease the creative process of a musician it is imaginable that some kind of automatic real time transcription of musical compositions can be developed which will eliminate the problem of having to interrupt the aforementioned process.\\\\
\section{Problem analysis}
Although the first system of musical notation is the Sumerian system of 3,500 years ago music has existed for much longer \cite{origins}. This means that people have been playing music without any form of written music until then. Even with the creation of standardised musical notation musicianship on high level is possible without any form of education and/or skills in reading and writing music. As such there continue to exist musicians without aforementioned skills.\\\\
Inability to read or write music poses no problem in itself, as it doesn't necessarily hinder musical creativity. Problems however arise when the need to convey or remember musical compositions presents itself. Just as standardised languages make everyday communication and tasks easier a standardised musical notation is needed to unobstructedly convey compositions to others. Standard musical notation has been created, but
