\chapter{System design and validation} \label{ch10}
With the concept and requirement for the system established in section \ref{sec:synth} and necessary theoretical knowledge obtained through chapter \ref{ch4} to \ref{ch7} system design are to be set up in this chapter. Test for validation of each unit will be carried out and documented along with the design process according to the test specifications in section \ref{sec:testspec}. The chapter concludes with a test of the final system followed by an evaluation.  \\
