\chapter{System design and validation} \label{ch10}
With the concept and requirements for the system established in section \ref{sec:synth} and necessary theoretical knowledge obtained through chapter \ref{ch4} to \ref{ch8}, the system design are to be set up in this chapter. Test for validation of each unit will be carried out and documented along with the design process according to the test specifications in section \ref{sec:testspec}. The chapter concludes with a test of the final system followed by an evaluation.

The implementations of the algorithms described below uses different basic functions from packages such as the Numpy-package, which is imported at the top of each script in Python as e.g. \textit{np}. A function from this package is accessed as \textit{np.function(input)}. The import of the packages are therefore not included in each algorithm in this chapter.
