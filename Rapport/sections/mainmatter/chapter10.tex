\chapter{System design and test} \label{ch10}
With the concept and requirements for the system established in section \ref{sec:synth} and necessary theoretical knowledge obtained through chapters \ref{ch4} to \ref{ch8}, the system design are to be set up in this chapter. Along with the design process tests of each unit will be carried out and documented - according to the test specifications in section \ref{sec:testspec}. The chapter concludes with a test of the final system followed by an evaluation.

The implementations of the algorithms described below uses different basic functions from packages such as the Numpy-package, which is imported at the top of each script in Python as e.g. \textit{np}. A function from this package is accessed as \textit{np.function(input)}. The import of the packages are therefore not included in each algorithm in this chapter.
