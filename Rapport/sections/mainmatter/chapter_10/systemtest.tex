In this section the final system is tested with varying input signal, according to evaluate at what level the application fulfil the practical purpose of the system. Cf. chapter \ref{ch3} the purpose of the system is to create a spectrogram from which the significant frequencies over time are recognized by the peak detection algorithm to match the frequencies known to be in the input signal - according to the tones or cords played.\\
