In this section the final system is tested with varying input signal, according to evaluate at what level the application fulfil the practical purpose of the system. Cf. chapter \ref{ch3} the purpose of the system is to create a spectrogram from which the significant frequencies over time are to be recognized by the peak detection algorithm to match the frequencies known to be in the input signal - according to the tone or cord played.

Figure \ref{fig:final_1} account for the system output of test 1. Bye this it is clear that the significant frequencies follows each scale. Though single incongruous frequencies appears, because of high\trine{low?} signal to noise ration within the passband at a certain time. From the result it is concluded that the scale is recognisable.
