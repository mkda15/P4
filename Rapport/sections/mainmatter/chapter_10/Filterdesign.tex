The filter design process is documented in this section, which includes determination of filter specifications, implementation and test. As stated in section \ref{sec:filtervalg} a bandpass FIR filter of type I designed with use of a Kaiser window is wanted.

\subsection{Specifications of filter} \label{sec:FIRspec} 
The purpose of this filter is to remove all frequencies outside the passband of the filter.  \\
Due to the frequency analysis in section ~\ref{sec:single} the main energy in the analysed signals is located within a frequencyband from 75 Hz to 1000 Hz.  
By letting the cut-off frequencies $f_c$ of the filter be respectively 75 Hz and 1000 Hz, this makes the passband of the filter. \\ 
According to section \ref{subsec:FIR} the Kaiser window can be determined from specifications of the allowed transition width $tw$ and peak approximation error $\delta$ of the amplitude in the pass- and stopbands. \\ 
By the frequency analysis of different types of noise it is found that the frequency spectrum of the music signal leis within the frequency spectrum of the noise which verifies the need of a narrow transitionband. However, the narrower transitionband means the higher order of filter is needed, which gives more computations, and hence it is not realistic to let the width of the transitionband go toward zero.  \\
The maximum allowed width of the transitionband $tw$ and peak approximation error in amplitude $\delta$ is determined as
\begin{align}
tw = 20 \ Hz, \ \ \ \ \  \delta = 0.05. 
\end{align}
The amplitude response of the ideal filter is sketched in figure \ref{fig:spec_Hd} along with the boundaries for the real filter as provided by the defined specifications.

\subsection{Implementation of filter}
The implementation of the filter basically follows algorithm \ref{alg:FIR}. The ideal impulse response is defined as the inverse Fourier transformation of the ideal filter specified in figure \ref{fig:spec_Hd}. The derivation of the ideal impulse response of a bandpass filter is shown in appendix \ref{appC}. Figure \ref{fig:freq_filt1} illustrates a plot of the amplitude response corresponding to the filter in the frequency domain. Figure \ref{fig:freq_filt2} illustrates a close-up view of the left transitionband, showing the ripples in the stop- and passband. The boundaries from the specifications are marked by the green lines. It is seen that the specifications are fulfilled.

\subsection{Test of the filter}
The implemented filter is tested according to the test specifications described in section \ref{sec:testspec}. Figure \ref{fig:SIGNAL} shows the frequency spectrum of the single low E tone with additive noise in form of a beat of hands clapping. Figure \ref{fig:filt_SIGNAL} shows the filtered signal. Note that the frequency spectrum are only showed from 0 to approximately 2200 Hz.

\end{subfigure}
\caption{(a) Frequency spectrum of signal with noise. (b) Frequency spectrum of filtered signal.}
\label{fig:test_res}
\end{figure}
As described in the specifications the filter is designed to remove all frequencies outside the frequencyband from 75 Hz to 1000 Hz. It is seen by comparing figure \ref{fig:SIGNAL} and figure \ref{fig:filt_SIGNAL} that the frequencies outside the passband appears to be zero and that the amplitudes of the remaining frequencies are appropriately the same. \\
By this the designed filter of order 2766 fulfil the specifications.\\
On behalf of this test it is assumed that by changing the cut off frequencies the filter can be modified to fit other music signals.
