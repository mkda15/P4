In this chapter sample theory and its importance when converting an analogue audio signal to a digital audio signal along with its complications is treated.
%\section{The frequency domain}
%The following sections look at functions in both the \textit{time}- and \textit{frequency} domains and utilizes the advantages of these different visualizations. To express a function of time as a function of frequency the \textit{Fourier transform} is used. The transform decomposes a periodic function $A$ of time $t$ into an amplitude valued function $\hat{A}$ of frequency $\omega$ and shows which amplitudes of frequencies of different sinusoids are present in the signal. The mathematical background for the Fourier transform is reserved for chapter \ref{ch5} - this chapter will make do with the graphical explanation in figures \ref{fig:time} and \ref{fig:freq}. Notice the both real and imaginary amplitudes of $\hat{A}$.

%The above figures illustrate the continuous Fourier transform. The transform can be discretized to the discrete Fourier transform, which is crucial, when working with sampled signals. This is likewise covered in chapter \ref{ch5}.
\section{Sampling}\label{sec:sampling}
In this section sampling will be defined mathematically which allows for a frequency analysis leading to the establishment of the important \textit{Sampling Theorem}.\\\\
Sampling is the process of representing a \textit{time-continuous} signal by a sequence of values. Doing so converts the time-continuous signal into a \textit{time-discrete} signal $x(n)$ \cite{pelgrom}. Sampling is usually done with digitalization of the signal in mind and this requires the signal to be discretized in amplitude too.\footnote{$x(n)$ is merely discrete in time and will be sufficient for the following mathematical representation of sampling.} When discretized in both time and amplitude the signal is referred to as $x[n]$. The relation between a continuous function $x_c(t)$ and the discrete funtion $x(n)$ obtained by sampling $x_c(t)$ is described by
\begin{equation}\label{eq:sampling_principle}
x(n)=x_c(nT_s)
\end{equation}
where $n\in\mathbb{Z}$ and the \textit{sampling period }$T_s$ (time between two consecutive samples) is determined by the \textit{sampling frequency} $f_s$ (samples pr. second). The relation between $T_s$, $f_s$ and the times of samplings is described by
\begin{equation}\label{eq:sample_freq}
\frac{n}{f_s}=nT_s, \phantom{mm} n=-\infty,\hdots-1,0,1\hdots,\infty \phantom{mm}\text{\cite{pelgrom}}
\end{equation}
where $n$ is the number of samples and $nT_s$ are points in time of sampling}.\\\\
To describe sampling mathematically the \textit{Dirac delta} function is introduced in definition \ref{def:dirac}.
\begin{definition}[Dirac delta function]\footnote{The Dirac delta function is defined as a distribution as no function satisfies the properties in definition \ref{def:dirac}. This definition is therefore non-rigorous but sufficient for the purposes of this section.}\label{def:dirac}
The Dirac delta function is the function $\delta$ satisfying
\begin{equation}
\int_{-\infty}^{\infty} \! f(t)\delta(t-t_0) \, dt=f(t_0).\phantom{mm}\text{\cite{pelgrom}}
\end{equation}
\end{definition}
The Dirac delta function is sometimes interpreted as a function $\delta$ satisfying
\begin{equation}
\delta(t)=\begin{cases}
0,\phantom{mm}t\neq 0\\
\int_{-\infty}^{\infty}\!\delta(t)\,dt=1
\end{cases}
\end{equation}
In signal processing the similar \textit{Kronecker delta sequence} is often used as a unit impulse and is defined in definition \ref{def:kronecker}.
\begin{definition}[Kronecker delta sequence]\label{def:kronecker}
The Kronecker delta sequence is $\{\delta_n\}_{n\in\mathbb{N}}$, where
\begin{equation}
\delta_n=
\begin{cases}1,\text{ for }n=0\\
0,\text{ otherwise}
\end{cases}\phantom{mm}n\in\mathbb{Z}\text{ \cite{DTSP}}
\end{equation}
\end{definition}
Depending on the context either the Dirac or the Kronecker delta may be used. In the context of this section, the Dirac delta is preferred, as it makes the mathematical analysis of sampling easier.\\\\
Summing an infinite number of Dirac functions shifted at equally spaced time intervals $nT_s$ as in \eqref{eq:dirac_sum} produces a constant function of equidistant Dirac pulses called a Dirac comb:
\begin{equation}\label{eq:dirac_sum}
s(t)=\sum_{n=-\infty}^{\infty}\delta(t-nT_s)\phantom{mm}\text{\cite{DTSP}}
\end{equation}
A Dirac comb is seen in figure \ref{fig:dirac_comb}.

\end{figure}
Multiplying a continuous signal with \eqref{eq:dirac_sum} and using the property of the Dirac function \eqref{eq:sampling} is obtained:
\begin{align}
x_s(t)&=x_c(t)s(t)\nonumber \\
&=x_c(t)\sum_{n=-\infty}^{\infty}\delta(t - nT_s)\nonumber \\
&=\sum_{n=-\infty}^{\infty}x_c(t)\delta(t - nT_s)\nonumber\\
&=\sum_{n=-\infty}^{\infty}x_c(nT_s)\delta(t - nT_s)\phantom{mm}
\label{eq:sampling}
\end{align}
\eqref{eq:sampling} is a mathematical representation of sampling of the continuous function $x_c(t)$ into the function $x_s(t)$ \cite{DTSP} - this process is seen in figures \ref{fig:signal1} where a signal is shown and \ref{fig:sampling_comb} where the signal is sampled by multiplication with a Dirac comb.

\end{figure}
Although \eqref{eq:sampling} mathematically describes sampling (as in converting a time-continuous signal to a time-discrete), we have $x_s(t)\neq x[n]$ as $x_s(t)$ is not discretized in amplitude whereas $x[n]$ is. Although $x_s(t)\neq x[n]$ \eqref{eq:sampling} will be useful in the upcoming appliance of the Fourier transform.
%\paragraph{Example of sampling} Sampling a ball following the arc shown in figure \ref{fig:ball_cont} results in the plotted points in figure \ref{fig:ball_disc}. As such the balls path is illustrated with discrete points along the path.

\subsection{Frequency representation of sampling}
Studying $x_s(t)$ and $s(t)$ in the frequency domain leads to some important conclusions about sampling. Before $s(t)$ is Fourier transformed it is expanded into its Fourier series:
%Firstly the Dirac delta function is Fourier transformed - the result follows directly from the definition of the Fourier transform and definition \ref{def:dirac}:
%\begin{equation}\label{eq:fourier_delta}
%\mathcal{F}[\delta(t)]=\Delta(\omega)=\int_{-\infty}^{\infty}\!\delta(t)\mathrm{e}^{-j\omega t}\,dt=\mathrm{e}^0=1
%\end{equation}
%\eqref{eq:fourier_delta} shows, that the Fourier transform of $\delta$ is a constant function of value 1. The Fourier transform of the Dirac comb $s(t)$ is given by expanding $s(t)$ with its Fourier series.
\begin{align*}
s(t)&=\sum_{n=-\infty}^{\infty}\delta(t-nT_s)\\
&=\sum_{n=-\infty}^{\infty}c_n\mathrm{e}^{j\omega nt/T_s}\\
\end{align*}
Calculation of the $c_n$ coefficients gives
\begin{align*}
c_n&=\frac{1}{T_s}\int_{t_0}^{t_0+T_s}\!s(t)\mathrm{e}^{j\omega t/T_s}\,dt=\frac{1}{T}\int_{-T_s/2}^{T_s/2}\!\delta(t)\mathrm{e}^{j\omega t/T_s}\,dt=\frac{1}{T_s}\mathrm{e}^0\\&=\frac{1}{T_s}.
\end{align*}
And so the Fourier series of $s(t)$ is
\begin{equation}\label{eq:dirac_series}
s(t)=\frac{1}{T_s}\sum_{n=-\infty}^{\infty}\mathrm{e}^{j\omega nt/T_s}\phantom{mm}\forall n\in\mathbb{Z}.
\end{equation}
\eqref{eq:dirac_series} shows that the Fourier series of $s(t)$ is merely an inifite number of phase shifted sines of equal frequencies summed. This makes the following Fourier transform easy:
\begin{align}
\mathcal{F}[s(t)](\omega)&=\frac{1}{T_s}\mathcal{F}\left[\sum_{n=-\infty}^{\infty}\mathrm{e}^{j\omega nt/T_s}\right](\omega)\nonumber\\
&=\frac{1}{T_s}\int_{-\infty}^{\infty}\!\sum_{n=-\infty}^{\infty}\mathrm{e}^{j\omega nt/T_s}\mathrm{e}^{-j\omega t}\,dt\nonumber\\
&=\frac{1}{T_s}\sum_{n=-\infty}^{\infty}\int_{-\infty}^{\infty}\!\mathrm{e}^{j\omega nt/T_s}\mathrm{e}^{-j\omega t},dt\nonumber\\
&=\frac{1}{T_s}\sum_{n=-\infty}^{\infty}\delta(\omega-\frac{n}{T_s})\nonumber\\
&=\frac{1}{T_s}\sum_{n=-\infty}^{\infty}\delta(\omega-n\omega_s)\label{eq:fourier_comb}
\end{align}
\eqref{eq:fourier_comb} shows that the Fourier transform of $s(t)$ results in another Dirac comb in the frequency domain with pulses seperated by $\omega_s$.
Calculating the Fourier transform of \eqref{eq:sampling} uses \eqref{eq:fourier_comb} and the fact, that \eqref{eq:sampling} is a product of two functions, which is a convolution in the frequency domain:
\begin{align}
\mathcal{F}[x_s(t)](\omega)&=\mathcal{F}[x_c(t)s(t)]\nonumber\\
&=\frac{1}{T}\sum_{k=-\infty}^{\infty}X_c(t)(\omega)*S(\omega)\phantom{mm}\nonumber\\
X_s(\omega)&=\frac{1}{T}\sum_{k=-\infty}^{\infty}X_c(\omega-k\omega_s)\label{eq:samp_freq}
\end{align}
Just as \eqref{eq:sampling} mathematically samples $x_c(t)$ in the time domain, \eqref{eq:samp_freq} mathematically samples $x_c(t)$ in the frequency domain at a rate of $\omega_s$. The following section \ref{sec:aliasing} draws conlusions regarding sampling frequency by studying $X(\omega)$.
\paragraph{Bandlimited signal}
A signal is \textit{bandlimited} if the signal contains no frequencies higher than some frequency $\omega_N$, which means $F(\omega)=0$ for $|\omega|>\omega_N$ \cite{FAA}. 
\subsection{Aliasing}\label{sec:aliasing}
\textit{Aliasing} is a consequence of not sampling  at a sufficiently high $f_s$ which results in the continous signal $x_c(t)$ being non reconstructable from the sampled signal $x_s(t)$.
\\\\
From \eqref{eq:samp_freq} it is seen that $X_s(\omega)$ consists of copies of $X_c$ repeated at whole multiples of $\omega_s$ on both sides of the origin - seen in figure \ref{fig:copies}.

\caption{Signal bandlimited by $\omega_N$ sampled at $\omega_s<2\omega_N$ in the frequency domain - the copies of $X_c$ overlap.}
\label{fig:overlap}
\end{figure}
\noindent It is clear from figure \ref{fig:copies} that if $\omega_s-\omega_N\geq \omega_N\Rightarrow \omega_s\geq 2\omega_N$ there is no overlap of the copies of $\hat{x}_c$. With an ideal low pass filter  a single isolated copy (centered around the origin) can be picked out, and the inverse Fourier transform used to recreate the time domain representation of the signal. If however $\omega_s-\omega_N\leq \omega_N\Rightarrow \omega_s\leq 2\omega_N$ the copies will overlap as seen in figure \ref{fig:overlap}. This is called aliasing. When a signal is aliased it is not possible to pick out a single copy of the sampled signal in the frequency domain which results in $x_c(t)$ not being reconstructable from $x_s(t)$. This makes aliasing in the context of representing a continuous signal as a discrete set of values unwanted.
\\\\
An extreme case of aliasing happens if the frequencies of two different signals differ from some whole multiple of $f_s$ by the same amount. The sequence of samples for the two signals will then be identical - this is seen in figures  \ref{fig:aliasing1} and \ref{fig:aliasing2} where two sine waves of different frequencies are sampled with the same $f_s$.

\noindent As such the reconstructability of $x_c$ from $x_s$ depends on the relation between $f_s$ and $\omega_N$ which leads to the central \textit{Sampling Theorem}.
\begin{theorem}[The Sampling Theorem]\cite{FAA}\label{sampling_theorem}
Let $f\in L^2$ and $F(\omega)=0$ for $|\omega|\geq \omega_N$ ($f$ bandlimited). Then $f$ is completely determined by its values at the points $t_n=\frac{n\pi}{\omega_N}$, $n=0,\pm 1,\pm 2,\ldots$:
\begin{equation*}
f(t)=\sum_{n=-\infty}^{\infty}f\left(\frac{n\pi}{\omega_N}\right)\mathrm{sinc}(\omega_Nt-n\pi)\phantom{mm}
\end{equation*}
where
\begin{equation}
\mathrm{sinc}(x)=\frac{\sin(x)}{x}
\end{equation}
\end{theorem}
\begin{proof}
Write the inverse Fourier transform of $f$
\begin{equation}\label{eq:proof1}
f(t)=\frac{1}{2\pi}\int_{-\omega_N}^{\omega_N}\!\hat{f}(\omega)\mathrm{e}^{j\omega t}\,dw
\end{equation}
By expanding $F$ into its Fourier series and using the negative index $-n$ we get
\begin{equation*}
F(\omega)=\sum_{n=-\infty}^{\infty}c_{-n}\mathrm{e}^{\frac{-in\pi\omega}{\omega_N}}
\end{equation*}
where $c_{-n}$ is given by
\begin{align*}
c_{-n}&=\frac{1}{2\omega_N}\int_{-\omega_N}^{\omega_N}\!F(\omega)\mathrm{e}^{\frac{in\pi\omega}{\omega_N}}\,dw\\
&=\frac{\pi}{\omega_N}f\left(\frac{n\pi}{\omega_N}\right).
\end{align*}
Then \eqref{eq:proof1} can be written as
\begin{align}
f(t)&=\frac{1}{2\omega_N}\int_{-\omega_N}^{\omega_N}\!\sum_{n=-\infty}^{\infty}f\left(\frac{n\pi}{\omega_N}\right)\mathrm{e}^{\frac{-jn\pi\omega}{\omega_N}}\mathrm{e}^{j\omega t}\,dw
\nonumber\\
&=\frac{1}{2\omega_N}\int_{-\omega_N}^{\omega_N}\!\lim_{N\to\infty}\sum_{n=-N}^{N}f\left(\frac{n\pi}{\omega_N}\right)\mathrm{e}^{\frac{-in\pi\omega}{\omega_N}}\mathrm{e}^{j\omega t}\,dw\label{eq:limit}
\end{align}
A linear and bounded operator is continuous. From theorem \ref{Plancherel} it follows that the Fourier transform is bounded and together with linearity of the Fourier transform it is continuous. This means that the limit in \eqref{eq:limit} can be moved outside of the integral and the summation and integral are then switched.
\begin{align*}
f(t)&=\frac{1}{2\omega_N}\sum_{n=-\infty}^{\infty}f\left(\frac{n\pi}{\omega_N}\right)\frac{\mathrm{e}^{j(\omega_Nt-n\pi)\omega/\omega_N}}{j(\omega_Nt-n\pi)/\omega_N}\Bigg|_{\omega=-\omega_N}^{\omega_N}
\\
&=\sum_{n=-\infty}^{\infty}f\left(\frac{n\pi}{\omega_N}\right)\frac{\sin(\omega_Nt-n\pi)}{\omega_Nt-n\pi}
\\
&=\sum_{n=-\infty}^{\infty}f\left(\frac{n\pi}{\omega_N}\right)\mathrm{sinc}(\omega_Nt-n\pi)\phantom{mm}\text{\cite{FAA}}
\end{align*}
\end{proof}
$\omega_N$ and $2\omega_N$ are commonly referred to as the \textit{Nyquist frequency} and \textit{Nyquist rate} respectively. The theorem can be interpreted as stating, that any signal bandlimited by some Nyquist frequency $\omega_N$ can be reconstructed by sampling it at the Nyquist rate $2\omega_N$. The theorem is therefore central to determining $f_s$ so as to be able to reconstruct $x_c$ from $x_s$. If the sampling frequency $\omega_s>2\omega_N$ the continuous signal is theoretically reconstructable from $x_s$ by summation of sinc-functions (theorem \ref{sampling_theorem}).\\
If, however, a signal is not bandlimited, the theorem does not apply and other measures must be taken. This leads to anti aliasing filters, which eliminate higher frequencies so aliasing is avoided when increasing sampling frequency is not wanted - see chapter \ref{ch7}.
\section{Analogue-to-digital conversion}\label{ADC}
An analogue-to-digital converter (ADC) is a device which converts an \textit{amplitude-continuous} signal to and \textit{amplitude-discrete} signal.  The analogue signal is in the case of this project voltage from a microphone reacting to sound waves. This section will establish the basic concepts of analog to digital conversion, but not explain the in-depth theory, as the conversion and the components used are not focus points of this project.
\\\\
The process of converting and analogue audio signal to a digital audio signal consists of the following elements:
\begin{enumerate}
\item A \textit{track-} or \textit{sample-and-hold} circuit capable of quantizing the signal in time.
\item An \textit{analog-to-digital converter} (ADC) capable of quantizing the signal in amplitude.
\end{enumerate}
If the signal is not completely understood or known, an \textit{anti-aliasing filter} to filter out unwanted high frequencies may be needed to avoid aliasing. Anti-aliasing filters are as earlier mentioned further explained in chapter \ref{ch7}. This is done before conversion of the signal from analogue to digital. The placement of an analogue to digital converter (and anti-aliasing filter) in a system to record sound to a digital storage unit is seen in figure \ref{fig:input}.

\subsubsection{Sample-and-hold}
\frede{Indsæt kasse med antialiseringsfilter.} A sample-and-hold (S\&H) circuit is responsible for discretizing a signal from continuous time to discrete time by sampling the signal at discrete points in time. An S\&H circuit measures a varying analogue signal (input) and creates a constant analogue signal (output) by "holding" the value of the initial signal for a period of time equal to $T_s$ \cite{pelgrom}. The constant signal can then be used for the whole duration $T_s$. It is worth noting, that the output of the S\&H circuit is not strictly discrete in time - it is merely constant in periods of time where the value of $x_c(t)$ is held. This allows the ADC to measure and quantize the amplitude and output this as a quantized value $x[n]$ at a discrete point in time.\\
In figure \ref{fig:S/H} an example of graphs of input and output of an S\&H is seen.

\end{figure}
\noindent The S\&H circuit must sample at a sufficiently high frequency as specified by theorem \ref{sampling_theorem}.
\subsubsection{Quatization}
Quantization is the process of discretizing analogue signal values to discrete values and is done with an analog-to-digital converter. Digital processors are incapable of dividing an interval into infinitely many subintervals (points), which means a finite number of intervals has to be used -  when an analogue signal is quantized its value is compared to a finite number of analogue values, rounded to the nearest and expressed in digital numbering (binary). The number of digital values therefore depends on the number of bits dedicated to representing a given analogue value as a digital number. When rounding the analogue value to a digital value, there is produced a round off error, which can be descreased by increasing the number of possible digital values in the interval \cite{pelgrom}.\\
In figure \ref{fig:quant} the graph of an analogue signal is seen alongside the quantization levels.

\end{figure}
\noindent There exist different ADCs \cite{pelgrom} all with the purpose of expressing a continuous analogue signal as a discrete and quantized digital signal. These different approaches will  not be described - the above description will make do for now. The process of sampling described in section \ref{sec:sampling} will be done with an ADC in the experiments later in the project.

\section{Signals and noise}
This project has the purpose of measuring some sound signal and process it in an advantageous way so as to be able to produce a spectrogram of said signal. It is therefore necessary to clarify what is meant by a signal and which kinds of signals are likely to be encountered.
\subsection{Signals}
A signal is "[\dots]\textit{a means of conveying information}[\dots]" \cite{signal_noise} and is in this project a sound signal consisting of sound waves from a musical instrument propagating in a medium (air) and measured by a membrane in a microphone and thereafter converted to an analogue voltage. As sound waves from musical instruments are no different than any other kind of sound waves they will all be measured by the microphone. These other sound waves will be referred to as \textit{noise}.
\subsection{Noise}
This section is mainly inspired by chapter 2 in \cite{signal_noise}.\\\\Noise is any measured interference of a signal conveying information and is merely another signal measured alongside the wanted signal where the noise carries information about the source of the noise.  Noise is generally thought of as unwanted as it can be hard to distinguish the signal from it and therefore extract the wanted information. Noise is present in almost all measurements of any signal and any measurement of a signal must therefore take this into consideration as noise limits the usability of measurements by
\begin{itemize}
\item reducing the accuracy of signal processing systems.
\item reducing the accuracy of decision making by pattern recognition.
\end{itemize}
The ability to counter noise depends on knowledge of the specific noise so as to be able to use the characteristics of the noise to distinguish it and the wanted signal from each other.
\\\\
In this project the noise is characterized as being \textit{acoustic noise}. Of this there are two kinds:
\begin{enumerate}
\item \textit{Additive acoustic noise}\\
Noise from moving or colliding objects. This is generally any disturbing signal stemming form outside of the system to be measured.
\item \textit{Acoustic feedback noise}\\
Noise due to echo or feedback. This incluedes reflection of sound waves on object and feedback by coupling of microphones and speakers.
\end{enumerate}
In addition to this noise is categorized by the characteristic of the spectrum of the noise:
\begin{itemize}
\item \textit{White noise}\\
Purely random noise with a constant power spectrum - all frequencies occur equally.
\item \textit{Band-limited (white) noise}\\
Bandlimited noise. White noise bandlimited in a spectrum that covers the spectrum of the interferred signal acts as true white noise with respect to the signal.
\item \textit{Coloured noise}\\
Any non white noise - noise which does not have a constant power spectrum.
\end{itemize}
As noise reduction is generally wanted, this project will also seek to eliminate it by recording music in an anechoic rum. Playing a pitch alone in an anechoic room is a way of minimizing noise factors. There are many different noise sources from e.g. the surrounding environment, electrical equipment, other people and even the instrument playing itself since it is difficult to make a pure tone by an acoustic sound source such as a guitar. A pure tone is a sinusoidal waveform consisting of a single frequency and may therefore be difficult to play on an instrument. \cite{AcousticNoise} Usually, sound is reflected off the walls in a room which is also a source of noise. This is a form of convolution and is minimized in the anechoic room because sound is absorbed by the walls. Moreover, due to the construction of the anechoic room, noise from e.g. bypassing cars is also minimized, and the sound may be recorded with a minimum of hardware which otherwise may also produce noise.
\\ \\
The music used in this project will therefore be recorded in an anechoic room because the noise is minimized. It is not expected that musicians using the system in the future have access to an anechoic room as well but if the system doesn't work with sounds recorded in the anechoic room then it with most certainty doesn't work at other places neither. However, in order to reproduce the conditions of a typical musician working around other people, background noise can also be made in the anechoic room but should of course not drown the music. This form of noise is additive whereas e.g. noise reflected off walls as mentioned above is folded with the original signal. In general, convolution noise depends on the state of the system whereas additive noise does not.
