\chapter{Frequency analysis and filter design} \label{ch9}
In this chapter the results from the recordings described in appendix \ref{recordings} will undergo frequency analysis. This will detect the frequency composition of the music and noise signals, which will aid the design of a filter designated to filter out noise. The frequency analysis is furthermore necessary for the creation of spectrograms illustrating the frequency composition of the signals in time. \\ \\
The project includes an implementation of the Cooley-Tukey FFT algorithm in Python but the results of this algorithm are identical to the FFT included in the Numpy package for Python which is \textit{much} faster than our implementation. The Numpy FFT will therefor be used for the frequency analysis in this chapter. \trine{evt. ref frem der viser de er ens}
