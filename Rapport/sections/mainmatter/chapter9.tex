\chapter{Frequency analysis and filter design} \label{ch9}
In this chapter the results from the recordings described in appendix \ref{recordings} will undergo frequency analysis. This will detect the frequency composition of the music and noise signals, which will aid the design of a filter designated to filter out noise. The frequency analysis is furthermore necessary for the creation of spectrograms illustrating the frequency composition of the signals in time. \\ \\
The frequency analysis is made in Python with the fast Fourier transform algorithm included in the numpy package \martin{Det er vel fair nok, når den er så hurtig i forhold til vores egen, men så skal vi lige (blive enige om at) skrive det. \textregistered}.
