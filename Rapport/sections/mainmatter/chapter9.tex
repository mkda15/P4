\chapter{Frequency analysis} \label{ch9}
In this chapter the results from the recordings described in appendix \ref{recordings} will undergo frequency analyses. This will detect the frequency compositions of the music and noise signals, which will aid the design of a filter designated to filter out noise. The frequency analyses is furthermore necessary for the creation of spectrograms illustrating the frequency compositions of the signals in time. \\ \\
This project includes an implementation of the Cooley-Tukey FFT algorithm in Python but the results of this algorithm are identical to the FFT included in the Numpy-package in Python, which is much faster than the implementation described in algorithm \ref{FFTalg}. The FFT from Numpy will therefore be used for the frequency analyses in this chapter.
