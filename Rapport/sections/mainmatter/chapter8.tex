\chapter{Filtering} \label{ch8}
In order to reduce noise present in a digital signal, this chapter introduces the basic digital filter theory necessary for the purpose of this project. Basic theory concerning mathematically ideal filters is described followed by design techniques of practical non-ideal filters. This chapter is inspired by \cite{chapters 5, 7, DTSP}, \cite{section 3.4.4, FSP}, and lecture notes from the course \textit{Diskret-tids systemer}.
