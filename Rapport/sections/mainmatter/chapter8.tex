\chapter{Filtering} \label{ch8}
In order to be able to reduce noise present in the recorded signal, this chapter introduces the basic filter theory necessary for the system. Basic theory concerning mathematically ideal filters is described followed by design techniques of practical non-ideal filters. This chapter is inspired by \cite{chapters 5, 7, DTSP}, \cite{section 3.4.4, FSP} and lecture notes from the course \textit{Diskret-tids systemer}. \\
Filters concerned in this project are only digital filters, which means that the filter is an algorithm to be executed on a computer. An analog filter is in contrast constructed by physical components.
