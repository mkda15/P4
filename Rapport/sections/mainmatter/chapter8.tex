\chapter{Filtering} \label{ch8}
In order to be able to reduce noise present in the recorded signal, this chapter introduces the basic filter theory necessary for the system. Basic theory concerning mathematically ideal filters is described followed by design techniques of practical non-ideal filters. This chapter is inspired by \cite{chapters 5, 7, DTSP}, \cite{section 3.4.4, FSP} and lecture notes from the course \textit{Diskret-tids systemer}. \\
Note that filters concerned in this project are only digital filters, meaning the filter is an algorithm to be executed on a computer. An analog filter is in contrast constructed by physical components. Both types rely on the input/output relation that are to be mathematically represented \martin{Sidste sætning skal nok omformuleres.
