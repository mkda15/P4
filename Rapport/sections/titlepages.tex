}{% the abstract
This report treats the problem of automatically transcribing a piece of music to a note sheet and seeks to develop an algorithm for this purpose. In order to do so the report uses the \textbf{Fourier transform} as a mathematical tool to perform \textbf{time and frequency analysis} of music signals recorded in an \textbf{anechoic room} at Aalborg University. The theory of \textbf{discrete-time systems} is described, and a \textbf{filter with finite impulse response} is designed for the purpose of filtering out \textbf{noise} added to the recorded signals. Furthermore, the trade-offs, advantages, and disadvantages of the Fourier transform and the implemented filter are considered. The frequencies appearing in the signals over time are visualised with a \textbf{spectrogram} generated with the use of a \textbf{short-time Fourier transform} and, finally, an \textbf{algorithm} capable of recognising significant frequencies in the music signals, so as to create a note sheet, is implemented. This algorithm is shown to be able to detect the frequencies of single tones within $\pm 5$ Hz.}}
