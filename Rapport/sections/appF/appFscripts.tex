\chapter{Supplementary files} \label{app:sup}
In addition to the report exist a folder containing fundamental python scripts used for this project and the audio files used as input. 
\\
The folder is located at: Link... \\
\\
Contents of the folder:
\begin{itemize}
\item[i.]\textit{Final\_application.py} \\
Script containing the final algorithm of the system developed in this project. The final test results can be recreated by this script, further it is possible to print result of each unit in the algorithm. Note that functions called in the script is defined in separate scripts described below.   

\item[ii.]\textit{fouriertransform.py}\\
Define function to compute FFT, DFT, STFT and dB representation.
 
\item[iii.] \textit{impulsrespons.py}\\
Defines functions to compute the impulse responses corresponding to lowpass, highpass, bandpass and bandstop filters.
\item[iv.] \textit{windowfunctions.py}\\
Defines functions to compute the windows functions corresponding to Bartlett, Hann, Hamming, Blackmann and Kaiser. 
\item[v.] \textit{peak\_detection.py} \\
Define the peak detection as a function.
\\
\\
Other scripts of interest:
\item[vi.] \textit{SNR\_variation.py} \\
Script for computing the test of varying SNR values, including plots.  
\item[vi.]\textit{spectrogram.py}\\
Script containing unit test of STFT involving generated test signal, including plots of spectrogram. 
\item[vii.] \textit{dbplots.py} \\
Compute db plots of the kaiser window, with varying M and $\beta$ values. 
  
\end{itemize}

To run the script in the folder \textit{python 2.7} has to be used. This can be downloaded from: \url{https://www.python.org/download/releases/2.7/}. All scripts has to run this exact folder.
